        Iâ€™m an engineer focused on building and scaling APIs and infrastructure that serve billions of requests every day. 
         <br />
        I lead projects end-to-end, from discovery, system design and cross team collaboration to development and deployment, while staying hands-on with performance tuning, CDN optimization, caching strategies, and code improvements. 
         <br />
        I prioritize observability and reliability, ensuring our systems are resilient and efficient at scale. 
        
        <br />
        As part of the on-call team (available 24/7), I handle high-pressure incidents, lead response efforts, and drive long-term fixes through postmortems and system improvements.
